# Networked-OS
The Networked OS: the stack of interfaces, protocols, communities, and income pathways that together shape a new model of life. In this world, the Networked OS is more than just infrastructure—it is a worldview. It is how individuals build resilience, meaning, and sovereignty in a decentralized age.


We are entering a new era of **Networked Living**.

People are moving across borders, earning in global currencies, coordinating in digital-first communities, and opting into self-designed systems of belonging and survival.

In this world, the **Networked OS** is more than just infrastructure—it is a worldview. It is how individuals build resilience, meaning, and sovereignty in a decentralized age.

This conference is not just about showcasing tools—it's about mapping a **lifestyle paradigm shift**. From borderless apps to sustainable solo economies, from new public goods to personal coordination stacks, we explore how individuals thrive in motion.


## What we are? 
**Networked OS Conference** is a gathering focused on a single timely question:

> **What are the tools, systems, and economic models powering the next generation of borderless, self-directed lives?**
> 

As global mobility, digital nomadism, and sovereign individualism accelerate, we are seeing the rise of a new class of applications—tools designed not for citizens of nations, but for citizens of the network. These applications cross borders, embed into everyday life, and serve as the infrastructure for work, identity, and community in motion.

We call this emerging paradigm the **Networked OS**: the stack of interfaces, protocols, communities, and income pathways that together shape a new model of life.

This conference is where we explore it.
